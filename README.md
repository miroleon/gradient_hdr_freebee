# Gradient HDR Pack Freebee

Welcome to the **Gradient HDR Freebie Pack**! This repository provides a glimpse into the full [Gradient HDR Pack](https://link-to-gumroad-product) available on Gumroad. Here, you'll find two selected HDRs used in my own artworks, perfect for stylized renderings.

## About The HDRs

The .hdr files in this pack are in varying resolutions, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of 3D applications. They're especially effective when used with reflective, chrome-like materials.

## Usage

Interested in effectively using these HDRs in your Three.js projects? I've put together a step-by-step [YouTube tutorial](https://youtube-link) and provided a [Codepen template code](https://codepen-link) for you to start with.
