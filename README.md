# Gradient HDR Pack Freebie

Welcome to the **Gradient HDR Freebie Pack**! This repository provides a glimpse into the full [Gradient HDR Pack](https://miroleon.gumroad.com/l/gradient_hdr_pack) available on Gumroad. Here, you'll find two selected HDRs used in my own artworks, perfect for stylised renderings.

## About The HDRs

The .hdr files in this pack are in varying resolutions and are compatible with a wide range of 3D applications. They're especially effective when used with reflective, chrome-like materials.

## Usage

Interested in effectively using these HDRs in your Three.js projects? I've put together a step-by-step [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/Muq-VpaPzoE) and provided a [Codepen template code](https://codepen.io/miroleon/pen/dyQdzKq) for you to start with.
